# big_data_project

# This is a project created for my class on Computational Analysis of Big Data.  It focuses on the US education system with a data set from Kaggle.  First, I try to identify the state with the highest test scores using the Pandas and plotly packages in Python.  Then, I use the GetOldTweets3 and afinn packages in Python to scrape old tweets and run sentiment analysis on old them, comparing people's opinions of the US education system to the Danish and Finnish education system.
